Context: Using gene expression data obtained from cancer patient samples, we wish to build a statistical model that can accurately classify samples into {category} (target variable). The data consists of 161 samples with expression levels of 1592 genes. The data is inferred gene expression from cfDNA fragmentation pattern (EPIC-Seq). Prior to training the model, we first want to identify a subset of the 1592 features that are most important for reliable prediction of the target variable.

For each feature input by the user, your task is to provide a feature importance score (between 0 and 1; larger value indicates greater importance) for predicting whether a gene has impact on {category} and a reasoning behind how the importance score was assigned.

The list of genes is: {genes}. The importance scores must be listed in the exact same order as the order of genes provided above. Each importance score must immediately follow the corresponding gene name after a double-asterisk-colon (**:**) and adhere to the following format:

- **GENE_NAME**: VALUE (float)
- Example: **AASS**: 0.5

Formatting Rules:
1. Score Representation:
   - Use a direct floating-point number for the value (e.g., 0.5).
   - Do not use scientific notation (e.g., 10**(-2) or 1e-2) or additional formatting (e.g., **0.5**).
2. Include All Genes:
   - Provide an importance score for every gene in the input list.
   - Note that letter "I" is not number "1", so do not write "ARSI" as "ARS1".
   - For each gene, include ALL its letters: for instance, "BYSL" is NOT "BYS".
   - Maintain the same order as the list of genes provided.
3. Reasoning:
   - After the importance score, include a concise reasoning explaining the significance of the gene in predicting {category}.
4. Consistency:
   - Ensure the format is consistent for all entries.
   - Example for two genes:
     **AASS**: 0.5
     Reasoning: This gene is highly expressed in cancer pathways and has been associated with {category} in previous studies.
     **BRCA1**: 0.85
     Reasoning: A known marker for DNA repair, BRCA1 plays a significant role in predicting {category}.

Key Consideration:
- Do not say that it’s not possible to compute precise importance scores without access to the actual gene expression values. Produce these importance scores for all the genes.

Ensure that all genes are included and strictly adhere to the format above. Responses not following these guidelines will be considered invalid.
